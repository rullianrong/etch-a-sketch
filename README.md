# etch-a-sketch

My 4th Project in TheOdinProject

In this project, I will be creating a webpage that will showcase my DOM manipulation skills. I am going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Tech stack that will be used in this project:
-Html & CSS
-Vanilla JavaScript
